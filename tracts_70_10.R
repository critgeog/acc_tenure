# Various stakeholder types in Athens' historically Black neighborhoods have requested data 
# on Black homeownership in Athens and how it has changed over several decades. 
# Specifically, the national trend is that it went down significantly post-Recession, 
# and folks want to know these figures for Athens Clarke County.

# It would be great to have the most detail possible, e.g. block groups.
# Maps and summary of trends very helpful.

# How hard is it to get data from different periods, e.g. the late 1960s or 1970s? 
# On this question

#I can get it for each of the  decennial census years. 
# Data from 1960,70, 80 is available at the census tract 
# (although census tracts were much larger then). 
# From 1990 on I think it is available at block group level. 
# starting in 2005 I can annual estimates
